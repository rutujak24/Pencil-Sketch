# Sketchify your Photo

### Ever wondered how the photo editing apps generate a automatic pencil sketch of your photo? Here is a micro-byte wherein you can Sketchify your Photo using Open CV.

Interesting image filter effects, such as a pencil sketch or a cartoonizer effect, do not have to be very computationally involved to look good. In fact, in order to create a beautiful black-and-white pencil sketch effect, all you essentially need is some blurring and two image blending techniques called dodging and burning.

Using OpenCV and Python, an RGB color image can be converted into a pencil sketch in four simple steps:

1. Convert the RGB color image to grayscale.
2. Invert the grayscale image to get a negative.
3. Apply a Gaussian blur to the negative from step 2.
4. Blend the grayscale image from step 1 with the blurred negative from step 3 using a color dodge.

## Prerequisites

For this micro-task, you should have a basic knowledge of:
* Python
* Open CV basics

If you are new to Open CV, here is how to install it on anaconda platform or your loacal machine.
[Install Open CV](https://pypi.org/project/opencv-python)

## Activities

**Note:** Remember to go through the additional material provided in the activities to have a more thorough understanding of the underlying concepts. Using OpenCV and Python, an RGB color image can be converted into a pencil sketch in four simple steps which are divide into activities:

### Activity 1 
Convert the RGB color image to grayscale.

> *Refer to src/Activity 1/Activity-1-RGB to Grayscale.ipynb*

### Activity 2
Invert the grayscale image to get a negative.

> *Refer to src/Activity 2/Activity-2-Invert Image.ipynb*


### Activity 3
Apply a Gaussian blur to the negative from activity 2.

> *Refer to src/Activity 3/Activity-3-Gaussian blur.ipynb*


### Activity 4
Blend the grayscale image from step 1 with the blurred negative from step 3 using a color dodge.

> *Refer to src/Activity 4/Activity-4-Color dodge.ipynb*

### Activity 5 
Combine all the above activities to make a working model

> *Refer to src/Activity 5/Activity-5-Do it yourself.ipynb*


## Summary

Now, you must be confident in the working with open cv in python. Also, you must be clear in the syntax, its use and implementation as an when necessary.
